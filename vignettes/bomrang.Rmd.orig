## Introduction

bomrang provides functions for interacting with 
[Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) Weather Data
Services](http://www.bom.gov.au/catalogue/data-feeds.shtml) forecasts. BOM
serves several types of data data as XML, JSON and SHTML files.
This package fetches these files, parses them and return a data frame.
Satellite and radar imagery files are also made available to the public via
anonymous FTP. bomrang provides functionality to query, fetch and create 
`raster::stack()` objects of the GeoTIFF imagery.

## Using bomrang

Several functions are provided by bomrang to retrieve Australian Bureau of
Meteorology (BOM) data. A family of functions retrieve weather data and return
data frames; `get_precis_forecast()`, which retrieves the précis (short)
forecast; `get_current_weather()`, which fetches the current weather from a
given station; `get_ag_bulletin()`, which retrieves the agriculture
bulletin; `get_weather_bulletin()` which fetches the 0900 and 1500 weather
bulletins; `get_coastal_forecast()` which fetches coastal waters forecasts for
each state and `get_historical()` which fetches historical daily temperature
min/max, rainfall, or solar exposure data. A second family of functions retrieve 
information pertaining to satellite and radar imagery, `get_available_imagery()`
and the imagery itself, `_imagery()` for satellite, and
`get_available_radar()` and `get_radar_imagery()`  for radar images. The last
group functions provides internal functionality for bomrang itself;
`update_forecast_towns()`, which updates an internal database of forecast
locations distributed with the package, `sweep_for_stations()` which returns the
nearest weather stations to a point in Australia and, `manage_cache()` that
provides facilities for managing cached satellite imagery.

## Using get_current_weather()

`get_current_weather()` takes one of two arguments: `station_name` and `latlon`,
returning the current weather observations (and the observations of the last 72
hours) for the given location.

If `station_name` is used, the weather observations for the last 72 hours are
returned for that station. If the string provided is ambiguous, the function
returns an observation for one of the possible stations and emits a warning to
offer unambiguous station names. 

If `latlon` is used, the observations returned are from the station nearest to
that latitude-longitude coordinate. `latlon` values are entered as decimal
degrees, _e.g._ `latlon = c(-34, 151)` for Sydney. The function also emits a
message, to tell the user which station was used.

### Results

The table returned will have different fields depending on the station that is
selected. 

### Example

Following is an example fetching the current weather for Melbourne.

```{r current_weather, eval=TRUE}
Melbourne_weather <- get_current_weather("Melbourne (Olympic Park)")
```

## Using get_precis_forecast()

This function only takes one argument, `state`. The `state` parameter allows the
user to select the forecast for just one state or a national forecast. States or
territories are specified using the official postal codes or full name with
fuzzy matching performed via `agrep()`

- **ACT** - Australian Capital Territory

- **NSW** - New South Wales

- **NT** - Northern Territory

- **QLD** - Queensland

- **SA** - South Australia

- **TAS** - Tasmania

- **VIC** - Victoria

- **WA** - Western Australia

- **AUS** - Australia, returns national forecast including all states, NT and
ACT.

### Results

The function, `get_precis_forecast()`, will return a data frame of the weather
forecast for the daily forecast for selected towns. See Appendix 1 for a full
description of the fields and values.

### Example

Following is an example fetching the forecast for Queensland.

```{r precis_forecast, eval=TRUE}
(QLD_forecast <- get_precis_forecast(state = "QLD"))
```


## Using get_ag_bulletin()

`get_ag_bulletin()` only takes one argument, `state`. The `state` parameter
allows the user to select the bulletin for just one state or a national
forecast. States or territories are specified using the official postal codes or
full name with fuzzy matching performed via `agrep()`.

- **NSW** - New South Wales

- **NT** - Northern Territory

- **QLD** - Queensland

- **SA** - South Australia

- **TAS** - Tasmania

- **VIC** - Victoria

- **WA** - Western Australia

- **AUS** - Australia, returns bulletin for all states and NT.

### Results

The function, `get_ag_bulletin()`, will return a data frame of the agriculture
bulletin for selected stations. See Appendix 3 for a full list and description
of the fields and values.

### Example

Following is an example fetching the ag bulletin for Queensland.

```{r ag_bulletin, eval=TRUE}
(QLD_bulletin <- get_ag_bulletin(state = "QLD"))
```

## Using get_weather_bulletin()

This function takes two arguments, `state` for the desired state; and `morning`
if `TRUE`, return the 9am bulletin for the nominated state; otherwise return the
3pm bulletin. States or territories are specified using the official postal
codes.

-   **ACT**  Australian Capital Territory (will return NSW)

-   **NSW** - New South Wales

-   **NT** - Northern Territory

-   **QLD** - Queensland

-   **SA** - South Australia

-   **TAS** - Tasmania

-   **VIC** - Victoria

-   **WA** - Western Australia

### Results

The function `get_weather_bulletin()` will return a data frame of BOM data for
the requested state(s) or territory.

### Example

Following is an example fetching the 9AM bulletin for Queensland.

```{r weather-bulletin-AM, eval=TRUE}
(qld_weather <- get_weather_bulletin(state = "QLD", morning = TRUE))
```

Following is an example fetching the 3PM bulletin for Queensland.

```{r weather-bulletin-PM, eval=TRUE}
(qld_weather <- get_weather_bulletin(state = "QLD"))
```


## Using get_coastal_forecast()

This function only takes one argument, `state`. The `state` parameter allows the
user to select the forecast for just one state or a national forecast. States or
territories are specified using the official postal codes or full name with
fuzzy matching performed via `agrep()`

- **ACT** - Australian Capital Territory

- **NSW** - New South Wales

- **NT** - Northern Territory

- **QLD** - Queensland

- **SA** - South Australia

- **TAS** - Tasmania

- **VIC** - Victoria

- **WA** - Western Australia

- **AUS** - Australia, returns national forecast including all states, NT and
ACT.

### Results

The function, `get_coastal_forecast()`, will return a data frame of the coastal
waters forecast for marine zones in each state. See Appendix 6 for a full
description of the fields and values.

### Example

Following is an example fetching the forecast for Queensland.

```{r coastal_forecast, eval=TRUE}
(QLD_coastal_forecast <- get_coastal_forecast(state = "QLD"))
```


## Using get_historical()

`get_historical()` takes either of two arguments: `stationid` and `latlon`, as 
well as a type of observation (`"rain"`, `"min"` (temperature), `"max"`
(temperature), or `"solar"`), returning the historical daily weather
observations of that type for the given location. An optional fourth argument,
`meta` returns a `list()` object of two data frames when set to `TRUE`. The
first table, `"meta"`, will include metadata on the station and data. The second
table, `"historical_data"`, will be as discussed in *Results* below.

If `latlon` is used, the observations returned are from the station nearest to
that latitude-longitude coordinate. `latlon` values are entered as decimal
degrees, _e.g._ -34, 151 for Sydney. The function also emits a message, to
tell the user which station was used.

### Results

The table returned may have different fields depending on the station that is
selected. The time period over which observations are available will be highly
dependent on the station requested. Some stations may only have a decade or less
of data (e.g. max temperature at `070351 (CANBERRA AIRPORT)` has ~3,700+
observations back to 2008) while others may have very extensive records (e.g.
rainfall at `ADELAIDE (WEST TERRACE / NGAYIRDAPIRA)` has ~65,000+ observations
back to 1839, three years after the city was founded.)

The optional metadata table will always have the following fields 
  
  - **site**: BOM station ID
  
  - **name**: BOM station name.
  
  - **lat**: Latitude in decimal degrees.
  
  - **lon**: Longitude in decimal degrees.
  
  - **start**: Date observations start.
  
  - **end**: Date observations end.
  
  - **years**: Available number of years data.
  
  - **percent**: Percent complete.
  
  - **AWS**: Automated weather station?
  
  - **type**: Measurement types available for the station.

### Example

Following is an example fetching the historical daily temperature minimum
observations for the station closest to 35.2809°S, 149.1300°E (Canberra).

```{r historical_mintemps, eval=TRUE}
(Canberra_mintemps <- get_historical(latlon = c(-35.2809, 149.1300),
                                     type = "min"))
```

## Using sweep_for_stations()

`sweep_for_stations()` only takes one argument, `latlon`, a length-2 numeric
vector. By default, this is Canberra (approximately).

### Results

This function will search for weather stations and return a data frame of all
weather stations (in this package) sorted by distance from `latlon`, ascending.
The fields in the data frame are:

**name** - station name

**lat** - latitude (decimal degrees)

**lon** - longitude (decimal degrees)

**distance** - distance from provided `latlon` value (kilometres).

### Example  

Following is an example sweeping for stations starting with Canberra.

```{r sweep_stations, eval=TRUE}
# Show only the first ten stations in the list
head(sweep_for_stations(latlon = c(-35.3, 149.2)), 10)
```


## Using sweep_for_forecast_towns()

`sweep_for_forecast_towns()` only takes one argument, `latlon`, a length-2
numeric vector. By default, this is Canberra (approximately).

### Results

This function will search for weather stations and return a data frame of all
weather stations (in this package) sorted by distance from `latlon`, ascending.
The fields in the data frame are:

**name** - forecast town

**lat** - latitude (decimal degrees)

**lon** - longitude (decimal degrees)

**distance** - distance from provided `latlon` value (kilometres).

### Example  

Following is an example sweeping for forecast towns starting with Canberra.

```{r sweep_forecast, eval=TRUE}
# Show only the first ten towns in the list
head(sweep_for_forecast_towns(latlon = c(-35.3, 149.2)), 10)
```

## Using the update functions

bomrang uses internal databases of station location data from BOM to provide
location and other metadata, _e.g._ elevation, station names, WMO codes, etc. to
make the process of querying for weather data faster. These databases are
created and packaged with bomrang for distribution and are updated with new
releases. Users have the option of updating these databases after installing
bomrang. While this option gives the users the ability to keep the databases
up-to-date and gives bomrang's authors flexibility in maintaining it, this
also means that reproducibility may be affected since the same version of
bomrang may have different databases on different machines. If reproducibility
is necessary, care should be taken to ensure that the version of the databases
is the same across different machines.

The databases consist of three files, used by bomrang, `AAC_codes.rda`, 
`JSONurl_latlon_by_station_name.rda` and `stations_site_list.rda`. These files
can be located on your local system by using the following command, 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
paste0(.libPaths(), "/bomrang/extdata")[1]
```

unless you have specified another location for library installations and
installed bomrang there, in which case it would still be in `bomrang/extdata`.

### Using update_forecast_towns()

`update_forecast_towns()` downloads the latest précis forecast locations
from the BOM server and updates bomrang's internal database of towns used for
forecast locations. This database is distributed with the package to make the
process faster when fetching the forecast. 

### Example

Following is an example updating the précis forecast locations internal
database.

```{r update_forecast_towns, eval=FALSE}
update_forecast_towns()
```

### Using update_station_locations

`update_station_locations()` downloads the latest station locations and metadata
and updates bomrang's internal databases that support the use of
`get_current_weather()` and `get_ag_bulletin()`. There is no need to use this
unless you know that a station exists in BOM's database that is not available in
the databases distributed with bomrang

### Example

Following is an example updating the précis forecast locations internal
database.

```{r update_station_locations, eval=FALSE}
update_station_locations()
```

## Using bomrang to retrieve satellite imagery

bomrang provides functionality to retrieve high-definition GeoTIFF satellite
imagery provided by BOM through public FTP with the following types of imagery
being available: i.)
[Infrared images](http://www.bom.gov.au/australia/satellite/about_images.shtml#ir),
ii.)
[Visible images](http://www.bom.gov.au/australia/satellite/about_images.shtml#vis)
and iii.)
[Clouds/surface composite](http://www.bom.gov.au/australia/satellite/about_images.shtml#cloud).

Valid BOM satellite Product IDs for GeoTIFF files include:

<table>
<tr><th>Product ID</th><th>Description</th><th>Type</th><th>Delete time</th></tr>
<tr><td>IDE00420</td><td>AHI cloud cover only 2km FD GEOS </td><td>Satellite</td><td style= "text-align: center;">24</td></tr>
<tr><td>IDE00421</td><td>AHI IR (Ch13) greyscale 2km FD GEOS </td><td>Satellite</td><td style= "text-align: center;">24</td></tr>

</table>

### Using get_available_imagery()

`get_available_imagery()` only takes one argument, `product_id`, a BOM identifier
for the imagery that you wish to check for available imagery. Using this
function will fetch a listing of BOM GeoTIFF satellite imagery from
[ftp://ftp.bom.gov.au/anon/gen/gms/](ftp://ftp.bom.gov.au/anon/gen/gms/) to
display which files are currently available for download. These files are
available at ten minute update frequency with a 24 hour delete time. 
This function can be used see the most recent files available and then specify
in the `_imagery()` function. If no valid Product ID is supplied,
defaults to all GeoTIFF images currently available.

```{r get_available_imagery, eval=TRUE}
(avail <- get_available_imagery(product_id = "IDE00425"))
```

### Using get_satellite_imagery()

`get_satellite_imagery()` fetches BOM satellite GeoTIFF imagery, returning a
raster stack object and takes three arguments. Files are available at
ten minute update frequency with a 24 hour delete time. It is suggested to check
file availability first by using `get_available_imagery()`. The arguments
are:

- `product_id`, a character value of the BOM product ID to download.
Alternatively, a vector of values from `get_available_imagery()` may be used
here. This argument is mandatory.

- `scans` a numeric value for the number of scans to download, starting with the
most recent and progressing backwards, *e.g.*, `1` - the most recent single scan
available , `6` - the most recent hour available, `12` - the most recent 2 hours
available, etc. Negating will return the oldest files first. Defaults to 1. This
argument is optional.

- `cache` a logical value that indicates whether or not to store image files
locally for later use?  If `FALSE`, the downloaded files are removed when R
session is closed. To take advantage of cached files in future sessions, set 
`TRUE`. Defaults to `FALSE`. This argument is optional. Cached files may be
managed with the `manage_cache()` function.

```{r get_satellite_imagery, eval=TRUE}
# Specify product ID and scans
i <- get_satellite_imagery(product_id = "IDE00425", scans = 1)

# Same, but use "avail" from prior to specify images for download
i <- get_satellite_imagery(product_id = avail, scans = 1)

# Cache image for later use
i <- get_satellite_imagery(product_id = avail, scans = 1, cache = TRUE)

plot(i)
```

## Using caching for satellite imagery

If you elect to use `cache = TRUE` when downloading imagery, note that the GTiff
files can be quite large and will fill disk space. By using the default
`cache = FALSE` the files will be deleted when the current R session is closed.

Should you chose to use caching, bomrang provided functions to interact with
the cached files:

- List files in the cache, `manage_cache$list()`
  
    - List info for single files,
  
        - `manage_cache$list()[1])`
  
        - `manage_cache$list()[2])`

- List info for all files, `manage_cache$details()`

- Delete files by name in cache, `manage_cache$delete()`

- Delete all files in cache, `manage_cache$delete_all()`

To access the files directly, outside of R, the following command will give you
the location of the directory:

`manage_cache$cache_path_get()`

## Using bomrang to retrieve radar imagery

bomrang provides functionality to retrieve the latest radar imagery provided
by BOM through public FTP. These are the latest snapshots for each radar
locations at various radar ranges _e.g._, 512km, 256km, 128km and 64km for some
stations.

### Using get_available_radar()

`get_available_radar()` fetches the available radar imagery from the BOM FTP and
returns a data frame for reference. This data frame contains the product_id 
which is required when using the `get_radar_imagery()` function. The files
available are the latest `.gif` files of BOM radar imagery which are typically
updated each 6-10 minutes. Only the most recent image is retrieved for each
radar location. There are usually several radar ranges available for each radar
location, such as 512km, 256km, 128km and possibly 64km. The arguments are:

* `radar_id`  which is the BOM radar ID number. This defaults to 'all' which 
will return a data frame of all radar ID's in Australia.

```{r, get_available_radar}
x <- get_available_radar()
head(x)  
```

### Using get_radar_imagery()

`get_radar_imagery()` fetches the latest BOM radar imagery for a given product
ID. The files available are the latest `.gif` files of BOM radar imagery which
are typically updated each 6-10 minutes. Only the most recent image is retrieved
for each radar location. There are usually several radar ranges available for
each radar location, such as 512km, 256km, 128km and possibly 64km. The only
argument is:

* `product_id` the BOM product_id associated with each radar imagery file. 
These can be obtained from the `get_available_radar()` function. This value must
be specified and the function will accept only one at a time.

```{r get_radar_imagery, fig.height=9, fig.width=8}
library(raster)
x <- get_radar_imagery(product_id = "IDR032")

# create a blank raster plot and add the radar layer
r <-
  raster::raster(
  ncol = 564,
  nrow = 524,
  xmn = 0,
  xmx = 524,
  ymn = 0,
  ymx = 564
  )
  values(r) <- NA
  plot(r)
  plot(x, add = TRUE)
```

# dplyr compatibility

Some returned objects have been classed as `bomrang_tbl` which allow dispatch for 
dplyr methods, _e.g._ `mutate()`, `filter()`, `select()`, `arrange()`, `slice()`,
`rename()`, and `group_by()` while preserving the header information.

For example:

```{r}
adlmax <- get_historical(stationid = "023000", type = "max")
adlmax

filter(adlmax, month == 10)
```

The `magrittr` pipe has also been re-exported, so that too can be used 
to chain together operations

```{r}
adlmax %>% 
  select(station_number, year:day, max_temperature) %>% 
  filter(month == 10)
```

## Appendix 4 - Output from get_weather_bulletin()

The function `get_weather_bulletin()` returns a data frame of weather
observations for 0900 or 1500 for a nominated state. Observations
differ between states, but contain some or all of the following fields. All
units are metric (temperatures in Celsius; wind speeds in kilometres per hour;
rainfall amounts in millimetres; pressure in hectoPascals). "AWS" in a station
name denotes observations from an Automatic Weather Station.

<tr><td>weather</td><td>Description of current weather</td></tr>
<tr><td>seastate (QLD only)</td><td>See below for description</td></tr>
</table><br>


Seastate is described by a text string formed from the three components of (sea
state, swell, direction). Sea state is denoted "C" (Calm), "SM" (Smooth), "SL"
(Slight), "M" (Moderate), "R" (Rough), "VR" (Very Rough), "H" (High), "VH" (Very
High), or "PH" (Phenomenal). Swell is denoted "LS" (Low Short), "LA" (Low
Average), "LL" (Low Long), "MS" (Moderate Short), "MA" (Mod Average), "ML" (Mod
Long), "HS" (Heavy Short), "HA" (heavy Average), "HL" (Heavy Long), or "C"
(Confused). Direction denotes direction from which the swell is coming.

Names of rainfall and temperature variables for some states include prefixes or
suffixes defining the time period over which observations apply (for example,
"temp_c_6hmax" for maximum temperature between 0980 and 1500, or "temp_c_9ammin"
for minimum temperature observed at 9am yet included in 1500 bulletin).
